title: Who am I?
---

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at DCD Lab, College of Computer Science, **[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)**. My major is computer science, and my supervisor is Prof. **[Jun Xiao](http://person.zju.edu.cn/junx)**. My primary research interest lies at the intersection of *deep learning*, *computer vision* and *natural language processing*. 
Specifically, my current research focuses on **visual understanding and reasoning** (*e.g.*, video inpainting, video question answering). I also have done some work on **artificial intelligence in finance**. 
It is my great honor to have an opportunity to work with Prof. **[Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/)** from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In addition, I have served as the invited reviewer for top-tier conferences like CVPR and AAAI.
